    <h1>Fundamentals of Trees</h1>
    <p>   In data structures, a tree is a hierarchical structure consisting of nodes connected 
        by edges. It is a widely used data structure that has many applications in computer 
        science, including in algorithms, database indexing, file systems, and artificial 
        intelligence. Here are some fundamental concepts related to trees in data structures:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nodes: The individual elements in a tree are called nodes. Each node contains a value, and may have one or more child nodes.
        </li>
        <li>Edges: The connections between nodes in a tree are called edges. Each edge represents a relationship between two nodes, typically a parent-child relationship.
        </li>
        <li>Root: The topmost node in a tree is called the root. It is the starting point for traversing the tree.
        </li>
        <li>Parent: A node that has one or more child nodes is called a parent. In other words, a parent is a node that is connected to one or more child nodes by edges.
        </li>
        <li>Child: A node that is connected to a parent node by an edge is called a child. A node may have zero or more children.
        </li>
        <li>Leaf: A node that has no children is called a leaf or a terminal node.
        </li>
    </ul>
